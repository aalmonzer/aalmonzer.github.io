title: thoughts on AI

I have some thoughts I wanted to write down. Since ChatGPT popped up 2023, everything has felt different. Whether you have a job or looking for one. No matter what industry each of us is working in. LLMs have affected our jobs, workflows, and daily lives in one way or another.
Even if your routine consists of just rotting in bed and doomscrolling for 10 hours a day, the content you ingest has been wildly different since.

#### the controversy
Over the last few years, people's impression of AI has been 'varied' to say the least. From the delusional optimists claiming it's replacing humans in every capacity imaginable and AGI following soon (anytime now), to the rabid haters, notably artists, being alert for any whiff of slop or any whiff of a human daring to incorporate AI slop into their work, to the LinkedIn fence-sitters with their generic takes of "it's not the AI it's person using it", "learn how to use AI, it's the most valuable skill", and the likes.

#### where ai works
It would be stupid not to acknowledge that LLMs have streamlined a lot braindead work. The most notable feature in my opinion is that it has made searching and researching, much faster. Whether you're deciding which product to buy, or digging through outdated documentation. Manually searching by yourself was a very tedious process compared to how fast it can be done now.

If you're buying a pair of headphones, you can instantly cross reference and summarize every nitpick everyone said about it on reddit. (you can imagine a lot of other extremely viable use cases but im too lazy to remember any others right now)

#### ai art
*What is art?* This old philosophical question has been renewed and it's more begged than ever. While I'm no philosopher, I don't really care what others consider 'art'. I wanted to form my own opinion of this. Because we could either be going through short-lived era of slop before people realize that it just isn't viable, or those twitter artists could be throwing a tantrum and living in denial of technological progress.

Unlike LLMs in general, video models seem to be getting better and better each day, and not in insignificant incremental ways. They don't seem to have plateaued unlike text models, that are still improving, but not nearly as fast or as good.

Over the last couple of years, I still haven't formed a definitive answer for this, but there are a few things that I know.

In my work in direct response video ad production, video and image models are being used aggressively whether to generate realistic photos, infographics, UGC content, and everything else you'd as an ad on facebook. The real counterparts haven't been replaced yet by any means, but their volumes are decreasing while at the same ads are being produced at a much faster rate. LLMs write the copy with some human direction, generate the images, and the clips. Some ads have AI in some form in every single part of the ad production process, and many of these ads perform very well and rake in a lot of money for the brand behind them.

When I think closely about this, I remember something a little bit relieving. The quality of 'content' created for social media ads has been in many cases low-quality in favor volume and speed in testing. Such is that nature of social media ads nowadays. They need to be created fast and tested fast, to see whether they bring results, and AI has aided this greatly.

This holds true even before LLMs. Brands would just rip content off the internet and repurpose it for their ad. I've even seen ads where a celebrity talks and they just slap their own voiceover and make them say what they want. The video looks off to a blind person, or so I thought, but they get sales anyway.

On the contrast, when I'm deep into my doomscrolling session, I find it frightening when I catch myself entertained by an AI video or worse yet, not being able to tell this was an AI video. I thought I'd always be able to tell. I have a tech degree, I've been editing videos for 5 years, and I've rigorously used every latest and greatest video gen model myself. But, every once in a while I fall hard on my face, finding that I wasn't able to spot an AI video.

As a result, this brings me back to the age-old question again. What is art? I don't know tbh. I'm not here to answer it. Not today.
